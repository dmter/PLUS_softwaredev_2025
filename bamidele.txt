I donâ€˜t like the milks produced in Austria, I have tasted several of them the end tast is like you're snuffing cow dung! They need to be more hygenic in their production lines.
I recommend eating bread with noodles because the feeling is heavenly! 
One German language word I have learned is "Kaput", it means a state of something/someone being spoilt, bad, not working, damaged, not functioning or out of service!
